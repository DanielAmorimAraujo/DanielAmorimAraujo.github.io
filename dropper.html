        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        <p>Dropper is a game where the objective is to keep the red square on the screen, by moving left and right through the gaps as the floors move up. There are also 'coins' along the way that can be collected to add to your score. It was coded and designed
            in Java using Android Studio. The game uses a game thread to constantly update and the game objects are drawn using a canvas. The game is currently still under development as new features, bug fixes, and a redesign is being worked on.</p>
